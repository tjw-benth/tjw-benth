# Hi there! I'm Tom (@tjw-benth) üëã
*Marine Biologist ‚Ä¢ Quantitative Ecologist ‚Ä¢ Data Science Enthusiast*

As a marine biologist turned quantitative ecologist, I'm passionate about unraveling how marine biodiversity responds to environmental change through computational modeling, experimental research, and innovative data analytics.

## üåä Currently working on
Developing trait-based computational models to simulate extinction sequences and biodiversity loss cascades, while conducting mesocosm experiments to understand organism responses to environmental stressors‚Äîall powered by R and emerging Python workflows.

## üëØ Looking to collaborate on
* **Quantitative marine ecology projects** - biodiversity modeling and ecosystem functioning
* **Arctic marine ecosystem research** - climate change impacts and adaptations
* **Experimental ecology workflows** - from mesocosm design to statistical analysis
* **Open-source ecological modeling tools** - R packages and computational frameworks
* **Environmental disturbance studies** - cumulative effects and ecosystem responses
* **Data visualization projects** - making complex ecological data accessible

## ü§ù Looking for help with
Advanced trait-based modeling techniques, scaling computational models for large ecological datasets, and integrating experimental data with predictive frameworks.

## üå± Currently learning
* **Python ecosystem** - expanding beyond R for larger-scale ecological modeling
* **Advanced statistical modeling** - Bayesian approaches and machine learning applications
* **HTML/CSS** - building better interfaces for ecological research tools
* **High-performance computing** - optimizing models for biodiversity simulations
* **RShiny applications** - interactive tools for ecological research

## üí¨ Ask me about
* **Marine benthic ecology** - community responses to environmental change
* **Arctic marine ecosystems** - polar biodiversity and climate impacts
* **Mesocosm experiments** - laboratory and field experimental design
* **Trait-based modeling** - computational approaches to biodiversity loss
* **Quantitative ecology** - statistical analysis of ecological patterns
* **R ecosystem** - from data wrangling to complex visualizations
* **Environmental disturbance analysis** - individual and cumulative stressor effects
* **Ecosystem functioning** - linking biodiversity to ecological processes

## ‚ö° Fun fact
My research journey takes me from Arctic field stations collecting benthic samples to laboratory mesocosms simulating future ocean conditions, and finally to computational models predicting ecosystem cascades. I love that modern marine ecology lets me combine hands-on fieldwork with cutting-edge data science.
